Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems
============================================================

I took the online Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems course (https://www.coursera.org/course/android) taught by Adam Porter from Jan 2014 - May 2014.

This repository contains my solutions to all the programming exercises.

(Note that this repository was created several months after the course had completed so as not to violate the honour code.)
